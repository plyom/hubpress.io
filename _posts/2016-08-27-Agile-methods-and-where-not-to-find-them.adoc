# Agile methods and where (not) to find them

Being Agile is popular these times. But what "being Agile" really mean for us, as software people?
More than that, are we actually acting accordingdly to the Agile principles?

In this article we will try to understand and reflect about some of our day-to-day situations and analyse if we're doing it the Agile Way.

## Definitions, definitions...

Before anything it is important to note that Agile Software Development includes several development methods that share a **set of principles**, so there is no "one way" of being Agile.

So, we need to focus on this set of principles stuff to understand what exactly means to be agile.

Lets look at the agile manifesto (yeah, again):

> "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."
> - Â© 2001, the Agile Manifesto authors. This declaration may be freely copied in any form, but only in its entirety through this notice.

That's so cool right? We can now trash everything that we hate about project management: processes, documentation, contracts and plans and start doing what is really important.

We all know that this is wrong, Agile is not about no planning, no processes and tools, no documentation and no contrct. Is about keeping plans, processes, tools, documents and contracts to the minimal necessary. But let's not focus on that, I'm sure everyone already read about it somewhere and knows how this boring stuff is still important on an Agile project.

But let's say that we somehow could avoid completely the boring part.

We would still have the left part, the important one, to be reaaaly good at, otherwise we would not be Agile, we would just not do boring stuff.

So, let's look at them with a little more care.

## Individuals and iteractions

This means we have to communicate and interact with other **people**. Yeah, people.

I think it is better to talk about actions and situations:

**Situation #1.** You look at your task in Trello, Jira or any other tool that you use to manage tasks (because the **tool is not important** remember?), code it, commit it and move the card to the next stage on the process, then you feel satisfied for the job well done. So smooth...

**Situation #2.** The Scrum Master of your team calls for the daily meeting and you basically present yourself at it feeling like how this is a waste of your precious time and how this will compromise the delivering of your work (yeah I know!), don't really listen to the others talking and talk about a report of the all tasks that you finished the day before and how awesome you were. Then you just rush back at your computer and you successfully remembered whare you stopped. Success.

**Situation #3.** At the Sprint Planning meeting you notice a task that can be much bigger than the what the team and keep quiet so you don't look incompetent in front of the Product Owner. Now you're safe.

**Situation #4.** You are the P.O and the developer starts talking about his problems with the automatic testing and how this cannot be avoided, so you take your Smartphone to look at the news, after all you are not concerned on developer problems, your only concern is when it will be ready. Then you leave the meeting with the set of tasks to be done and a deadline.

Looks familiar?

So, surprise! **You are not being Agile!**

Everyone in an Agile Team must have communication as a priority. 
That means that everyone has to **talk about anything that can affect the project** at any level and do it clearly butm most of all, when you are at the listening side of any conversation - be it im a meeting or in a one-to-one conversation - **it is your obligation to listen very carefully** to everything that is being said.

As hard as it looks like, we basically have to talk about what we're doing, what we're building and what we're thinking and we must listen when anyone talks too.

Does it still looks that easy to you?

## Working software

This basically means that the software can be deliverable and not only as a "not break stuff" and "no bugs" but as a business. Do the software is really helping his users as it should?

Let's go to the situations:

**Situation #1.** You completed all your tasks in the Sprint a little earlier than expected and everything works fine at when you merged to the master branch. You noticed that are still a few tasks being finished so you go home early to preserve energy fot the Sprint Review next day. When you arrive, you see that one of the features that you implemented turned up broken by one of the latest commits and there will be no time to fix it before the meeting. You look angry at the team and wonder how they would survive without you. The software broke at the Sprint Review, but it wasn't your fault so you blame the commit author who did it.

**Situation #2.** During the Sprint Planning, as a P.O, you look at the Spring Backlog and the Increment look so small that you feel that you can push the team a litte harder, you don't really remember all the tech talk but this just feels right. You convince the team to add a few more tasks to the Sprint because of the tight budget, this way you could brag in front of the investor. The sprint fails because of a bug that prevents the user to sign in. You look at them with reproval eyes and hope this experience makes the work harder next time.

**Situation #3.** The Sprint ended up too big and the team is overworked with the features, you call the team and suggests to remove automatic testing from this last tasks so we can deliver on time. The team agrees and the sprint was a success, but on the next Sprint you couldn't convince everyone that the team should take less tasks this time. The team ended up writing less tests and, after 3 Sprints, the code starts to break almost everywhere, so now you advise on doing some "Unit Testing Sprints" and it should take at least 2 Sprints, but the budget can't handle it. The team will have to do it in 1 Sprint. Making you very frustrated and think on how awesome it would be if they listened to you for a change.

Believe it or not... **You are not being Agile!**

Everyone has to be concerned on having a stable software after every increment. Your good individual work means nothing if the product increment does not run. Fitting more features means nothing if the team has to neglect testing hoping the bugs doesn't get found by at the Sprint Review.

Being agile is about making small increments that gradually creates a bigger product but the quality of these increments must not be negotiated at any moment.

This is looking like a mexican novel already, right?

## Customer collaboration

I can almost feel the big "sight" coming. Yeah, you have to collaborate with the customer, even if he understands absolutelly nothing of techology and coding.

I will just cite a few situations, but I absolutelly KNOW you are already thinking about tons of them:

**Situation #1.** The customer was very specific on some features he believes as critical and won't sign a contract unless you add these features to the contract, but he likes the term Agile so he also wants you to use it in his project. You know that talking about features on the contract is not the best scenario but agrees with it and sign the contract with the intention of proving the customer how wrong he was. The project fails miserably.

**Situation #2.** The customer wants to implement a feature that is nowhere near the current best practice in UX for the product platform and have nothing to do with it's value propostition. You try to argue a little bit on how this can be complex and won't add value to the product but the customer seems irredutible. You give up knowing that the project will take at least a Sprint more without adding real value to the user, but since the money is coming from him, that's no big deal.

Guess what? **You are not being Agile!**

Customer collaboration doesn't mean to do everything the customer wants. It is about using your expertise to help on the improvement of his project. Sometimes it means to have harsh conversations with him and prove your point, remembering always that what you're doing is delivering real value to the user, not to inflate the ego of yourself or the customer.

The thing is, the Team (and by Team I mean every human on the Team), must have close contact to the end customer (a human too!). Everyone must understand the why's of the product you are building and for who (humans again) you're building and finally who will actually use (surprise, more humans) what you're building. There is no espaping that, no matter how we try or how we would like it. If you want to be a sucessful team member, you must collaborate with the customer at every level. So you, as a human must collaborate with other humans.

## Responding to change

This is one of the most beautiful things on paper, because everyone knows that things can change overnight so a 12 months  project is just a thing that will have exactly 365 opportunities to change and this cannot be avoided.

But what is your Team doing to be responding fast o changes?

**Situation #1.** You developed a beautiful code, full of patterns and well named variables for a feature that the customer now wants off the product. You actually agrees with it because that feature is almost never used by the users. The problem is that you didn't plan for it be remove so, right now, it is ultmost difficult because one of the patterns that you used here is used elsewhere and it is too much coupled. So you come up with difficult terms about how this could compromise the product and convince him that this feature must stay as it is.

**Situation #2.** At some point during the project the team stopped to write unit tests because it was demanding too much effort and an agile team must deliver new features fast. The code escalated quickly and, now, it started to give goosebumps on the developers everytime a significant change is done. You understand that the sprints cannot ship broken things so you and the team started to accept less and less tasks on the sprint's backlog. Unit testing became so hard that the team never restarted to unit test and you began to think about trashing the whole source code and do it all over, but never spoke it out loud because it would mean you did a poor job.

Altogether now! **You are not being Agile!**

So, basically, we need to be flexible and build flexible software.
That means that everyone in the team must never twist their nose on changes. They must embrace it.
This also means to create modularized (so we can change only what is needed), unit tested (so we can be confident to change it) and beautiful code (so everyone actually wants to work on it).

## But where to find these values then?

I believe that we train our Agile behavior - working on our communication skills and how to suppress our egos, reminding to deliver real value to the end user at all times, focusing on building things that we are really proud of - we can lead agile software projects to success.

The Agile Way is not instinctive to us, adult humans, and sometimes we will end up moving ourselves towards the traditional ways and expecting some manager to solve the problems for us.

The Agile Way is, also, not obvious like we would like it to be and sometimes we will have trouble convincing people that it actually delivers more results than the traditional management, but it is our job to find ways of showing its value.

Happy Agile training.
